        <h1>Submission Rules</h1>
        <p>Although I want this club to be nothing but dumb fun, I think it's important to set some ground rules to ensure that every member can participate in a way that aligns with this club's goal of having a good time.</p>

        <h2>[1] Avoid Making Low Effort Entries</h2>
        <p>This does not mean your art needs to be good. There just needs to be a clear effort put into your entry. If you feel like you cannot finish a prompt in time, it's okay! Take your time. The quality of the art is far more important than the quantity of it.</p>

        <h2>[2] Spoiler Sensitive Content</h2>
        <p>If you think your work contains sensitive or triggering content, kindly check of the spoiler checkbox. This will temporarily hide your drawing until a member chooses to view it</p>

        <h3>Permitted with a Spoiler</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Eyestrain / Epileptic imagery</li>
            <li>Detailed wounds and injuries</li>
            <li>Realistic Blood / Raw Meat / Organs</li>
            <li>Unsettling Imagery / Body horror</li>
            <li>Allusion to Suicide / Self-harm</li>
            <li>Usage of Drugs and Alcohol</li>
            <li>Artistic Nudity</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>NOT Permit at All!</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Explicit NSFW content</li>
            <li>Fetish content of any kind!</li>
            <li>Extreme depiction of gore and violence</li>
            <li>Bigoted depictions of minorities</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>[3] Drawing Prompts in Advance is Permitted</h2>
        <p>For the sake of automation, this website stores all it's prompts in a json file that is completely accessible to everyone. For this reason, I give people full permission to draw future prompts in advance. Although it is permitted, I strong recommend against it because I cannot guarantee that those prompts will stay and the date on which they'll be posted may be subject to change.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, drawing for past prompts is also allowed!</p>
        
        <h2>[4] No Using of Generative Artificial Intelligence</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this club is to make art! You need to be the one to start and finish an entry! Using Generative Artificial Intelligence as a shortcut is incredibly inconsiderate to the other members who put in the time and effort to interpret and illustrate the prompts.

        <h2>[5] Be Respectful of Other's Entries!</h2>
        <p>Please understand we are all in our own art journeys - which will not always look the same. Do not insult or discourage artists for making 'bad' art.</p>

        <h1>QnA</h1>
        <h2>Do I need to be a member to participate?</h2>
        <p>Nope! The member list only exists so that members can find and support each other. Nothing is stopping you from submitting an entry as a non-member.</p>

        <h2>What if I'm not an artist?</h2>
        <p>Art is for <i>everyone</i>. It doesn't matter if you're a long time professional or a recent hobbyist - Artists of all skill level are invited here. What's important is you enjoy making the art!</p>

        <h2>What medium should I use?</h2>
        <p>All art mediums are accepted! You can do traditional or digital. You can make a 3d model or paper cut-out collages. Anything goes! - just as long you are the one making it.</p>
        
        <h2>What if I miss a prompt?</h2>
        <p>That's okay! Just work at your own pace. You are allowed to go back to a previous prompt.</p>
        
        <h2>Will I get removed if I'm inactive?</h2>
        <p>I will only remove members who's websites I can no longer access - I'll probably check from time to time. So if you ever change domains, please inform me <a href="meta/help.html">here</a>!</p>

        <h2>What if I don't have a website?</h2>
        <p>Just as long your art is somewhere you can hotlink, it's alright. If you ever sign up for the members list, you may list your main social media account as the website link.</p>

        <h2>Where can I host my images?</h2>
        <p>Preferably you host your images in your own website. If you're concerned about storage, you can always compress your images to jpgs or webp. You can use <a href="https://bulkresizephotos.com/" target="_blank">this website</a> to compress images at bulk.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">If for whatever reason you can't host them yourself, here are some image hosting sites:</p>
        <ul class="db-list">
            <li><a href="https://imgur.com/">Imgur</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://filegarden.com/">Filegarden</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://imgbox.com/">Imgbox</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://postimages.org/">Postimages</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>I still have questions!</h2>
